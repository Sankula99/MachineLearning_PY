🏠 Canadian Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in Canada based on various property and market-related features. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates home prices, helping stakeholders such as buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

📊 Project Overview
Housing prices are influenced by multiple factors including location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, property type, and more. This project analyzes such factors using real-world housing data from Canada and applies various regression algorithms to predict the price of a house.

✅ Key Features
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand trends, correlations, and data distributions.

🧼 Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features.

🧠 Model Training: Apply multiple regression models including:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM)

📈 Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.

🚀 Hyperparameter Tuning: Improve model performance using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

📦 Deployment (optional): Export the trained model for use in production or further development.
