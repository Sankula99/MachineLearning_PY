🏠 Canadian Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in Canada based on various property and market-related features. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates home prices, helping stakeholders such as buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

📊 Project Overview
Housing prices are influenced by multiple factors including longitude  latitude  housing_median_age  total_rooms  total_bedrooms  population  households  median_income  median_house_value and  ocean_proximity. This project analyzes such factors using  housing data from Canada (Kaggle) and applies various regression algorithms to predict the price of a house. This Project used Python and the associated packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn and seaborn).

✅ Key Features
